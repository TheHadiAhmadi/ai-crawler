# Product Context: AI Web Crawler CLI Tool

## Problem Statement
Users often need to quickly find specific information from the web without manually searching through multiple websites and pages. Traditional search engines provide links to relevant pages, but users still need to visit these pages and extract the information themselves. This process is time-consuming and inefficient, especially for straightforward factual queries.

## Solution
The AI Web Crawler CLI tool addresses this problem by:
1. Accepting natural language queries directly from the command line
2. Automatically searching and crawling relevant web pages
3. Extracting the specific information requested
4. Presenting the results in a clean, readable markdown format

## Target Users
- Developers who prefer command-line tools
- Researchers who need to gather information efficiently
- Data analysts who need quick access to web data
- Technical users who want to automate information retrieval
- Anyone who wants direct answers without browsing multiple websites

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Users should be able to ask questions in natural language without learning complex syntax
- **Accuracy**: Results should directly answer the user's query with relevant information
- **Speed**: The tool should return results quickly, saving time compared to manual searching
- **Readability**: Information should be presented in a clean, well-formatted markdown structure
- **Reliability**: The tool should consistently provide useful results across a wide range of queries

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Factual Queries**: "What is the price of iPhone 16?"
2. **Comparison Queries**: "What are the differences between Python and JavaScript?"
3. **Current Information**: "What is the weather in New York today?"
4. **Statistical Information**: "What is the population of Tokyo?"
5. **Product Information**: "What are the specifications of the latest MacBook Pro?"

### Secondary Use Cases
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering specific data points from multiple sources
2. **Research Assistance**: Finding relevant information for research projects
3. **Market Monitoring**: Tracking prices or availability of products
4. **News Summarization**: Getting the latest information on specific topics
5. **Technical Documentation**: Finding specific technical details or documentation

## Key Differentiators
- **Command-Line Interface**: Unlike web-based search tools, this operates entirely in the terminal
- **Direct Answers**: Provides specific information rather than just links to websites
- **Markdown Output**: Results are formatted for readability and can be easily integrated into documentation
- **Focused Crawling**: Only searches relevant pages rather than the entire web
- **Automation Potential**: Can be integrated into scripts and automated workflows
