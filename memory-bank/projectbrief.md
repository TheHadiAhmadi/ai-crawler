# Project Brief: AI Web Crawler CLI Tool

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a command-line interface (CLI) tool that can search and crawl the web to find information based on user queries. The tool will process natural language queries like "what is the price of iPhone 16" and return results in markdown format.

## Core Requirements
1. Accept natural language queries from the command line
2. Search and crawl relevant web pages to find information
3. Extract and process the relevant data from web pages
4. Format and present results in markdown
5. Provide accurate and up-to-date information

## Technical Goals
- Create a robust web crawling mechanism
- Implement effective search algorithms
- Develop natural language processing capabilities
- Ensure proper error handling and edge cases
- Optimize for performance and resource usage

## Success Criteria
- The tool correctly interprets a wide range of queries
- Search results are relevant and accurate
- Information is presented in a clean, readable markdown format
- The tool operates efficiently with reasonable response times
- The codebase is maintainable and well-documented

## Constraints
- Must work as a CLI tool
- Output must be in markdown format
- Should respect website robots.txt and crawling policies
- Must handle rate limiting and avoid getting blocked by websites
